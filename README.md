# hello-world
A repository where I may store ideas, resources, or share and discuss with others

I am a neophyte programmer; a "Newbie", "newb" or "noob" in the parlance of the internet.

I am attempting to learn programming as a potential new career path. I have begun this pursuit by utilizing freeCodeCamp. I am currently pursuing their Front End Development Certification. My end goal is to obtain enough knowledge and experience to change careers from my current admin track to a more development oriented direction. I am intrigued by the creativity and analytical skills required to be successful. I also cherish the opportunity to enter a career that will require a lifetime of learning.

This is a quite new experience for me. I have a BA in History and an AA in Persian Farsi. Prior to those studies I dabbled in Materials Science and Engineering. As such I was exposed to an Intro to Java class years ago, as well as, an Intro to EE class. But by and large my experiences are as far from computers as you can get.

I look forward to this new academcic journey and furthering my knowledge. It seems quite exciting so far!
